🧐 About The Project

The Soulful Shayar is a digital sanctuary for poetry lovers. Unlike typical web apps, this project is built entirely with Vanilla Node.js—stripping away frameworks like Express to demonstrate the raw power of JavaScript's core modules (http, url, querystring).

It serves a beautiful, parchment-styled UI where users can read poetry, submit their own verses, and connect through words.
