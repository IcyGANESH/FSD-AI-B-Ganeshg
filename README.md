📖 About The Project

The Soulful Shayar is a dedicated platform for poetry lovers, built entirely with pure Node.js (no Express framework used!). It demonstrates the power of core JavaScript modules like http, url, and querystring to create a fully functional web server with routing.

Users can explore different emotions through verse, submit their own creations, and provide feedback—all served through a warm, paper-textured UI.

✨ Key Features

🎭 Emotional Categories: Dedicated routes for Love and Sad Shayari.

📝 Submission System: A working form to submit your own poetry (handled via POST requests).

💌 Feedback Loop: An interactive contact form that logs user input to the server console.

🎨 Responsive UI: Beautiful, mobile-friendly design using modern CSS.

⚡ Zero Dependencies: Built using only native Node.js modules.
